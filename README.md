Sentiment Analysis â€“ Amazon Reviews on Bosch-3397010057-Performance-Replacement-Wiper

Project Background:
Social media, as a platform for socializing and communicating, has evolved greatly over the past decade. It now serves as medium for people to express their views, displeasures and appreciation to people and companies about their services and products. Because of this openness and ease to share feedback, companies target social media to understand their customers better. This project will help us understand how consumer sentiment extracted from the tweets through machine learning can be used to generate insights regarding product acceptability and performance in the market.
